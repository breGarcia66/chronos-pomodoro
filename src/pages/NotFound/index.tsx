            Oops! Looks like the page you're trying to access doesn't exist.
            Maybe she took a vacation, decided to explore the universe, or got
            lost somewhere between two black holes. ðŸŒŒ
          </p>
          <p>
            But don't worry, you're not lost in space (yet). You can safely
            return to the <a href="/">home page</a> or{" "}
            <a href="/history">history</a> â€” or you can stay here and pretend
            you found a secret page that only the coolest explorers can access.
            ðŸ§­âœ¨
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think this page should exist (or if you want to chat about
            time travel and wormholes), just get in touch. Otherwise, use the
            menu to get back to the real world.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, here's a thought: "If a page doesn't exist on the
            internet, did it really exist?" ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
